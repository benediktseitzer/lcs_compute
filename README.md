# lcs_compute
This Code calculates Lagrangian Coherent Structures using the classics FTLE approach and the variational theory by [Haller (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physd.2010.11.010) and [Farazmand & Haller (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3690153).

## src/ 
Source Code for FTLE and LCS computation. Main is the lcs.f90 file. Included are modules for integration (time-stepping), interpolation and an extra module for the computation of the variational theory. 

## lcs_python/ 
This is a collection of short first-peak plotting scripts for output-data delivered by src/ 

## stuff_needed/
A list of needed libraries is being delivered in future.
